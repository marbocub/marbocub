I earned a high school equivalency diploma and pursued university studies after turning 30. Following my Master of Engineering degree in graduate school, I conducted research in a doctoral program. My research specialties include natural language processing, wireless communications, and all-optical signal processing. In addition, I obtained a high school teaching license through coursework at another university.

My professional background includes serving as an editor for *Transistor Technology*, a technical magazine published in Japan; working as a system engineer at a major playhouse in Japan; at a venture company, where I worked on embedded cryptographic implementations—for example, implementing the Rijndael cipher in C and assembly with world‑leading performance at the time—developed a well‑known commercial accounting software package, and contributed to system architecture for academic institutions; lecturing at Tokyo University of Science; and working as the manager of the system administration department at a prestigious women’s university in Japan.

I am also a networking professional with expertise in Cisco switches and routers, Palo Alto and FortiGate firewalls, Wi-Fi systems, and SINET (the Science Information Network of Japan).

I have experience with a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Pascal, SQL, Java, C#, Scheme, Perl, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, VB, shell scripting, and x86 assembly.

Furthermore, I have expertise in mechanical design and 3D CAD. My current interests include 3D printing and five-axis CNC machining.
